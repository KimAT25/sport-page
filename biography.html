      <h2>Childhood</h2>

      <p>
        Sébastien has been a sportsman at heart from the earliest days.
        Following his father’s steps – a former gymnast champion – Sébastien
        started practising gymnastics only aged 3. He quickly entered
        competition and, in a matter of 12 years, forged himself a solid track
        record: four-time Alsatian champion, once champion of the French Grand
        East, and fifth in the French championship.

      <p>
        Sebastian left high school. He wanted something concrete and found it
        when he graduated as a construction electrician. As soon as he starts
        working, his entire income gets absorbed by the object of his dreams: a
        Renault 5 GT Turbo. Rubber tires died after 2,500 km and his driving
        license is more often found at the station than in his pocket!

        His piloting apprenticeship began and soon revealed innate qualities.
        Sébastien tortured some GTIs before reading about the French ‘Rallye
        Jeune’ organisation which aims to reveal young talents. Aged 21,
        Sébastien scraped together to get by the 100 FR needed for registration.
        He won the regional selection and then the final of Castellet, but his
        closest competitor – Nicolas Bernardi – is handed the victory. Sébastien
        failed again in 1996’s finals. No matter: he is confident in his speed
        and abilities, only finances are missing to get started.

        Nine times world champion, Sébastien retires from the discipline in 2013
        without electing a candidate for his succession. He starts a successful
        career change in the circuit racing: first in FIA GT Series then in WTCC
        in 2014 and 2015 while continuing his collaboration with Citroën Racing.
        This relationship suddenly ends in 2015, after a series of fifteen
        successful years. He is consequently transferred to Peugeot Sport’s
        rallye-raid and rallycross programmes. Sébastien Loeb EnfantFrom 2016,
        Sébastien takes part in the Dakar Rally and the WRX Rallycross World
        Championship. That’s three Dakar rallies where he swings between
        newcomer and expert along with three not highly successful rallycross
        seasons driving an undeveloped vehicle and his team’s sudden withdrawal
        in 2018. 2018 is Sébastien’s come back in WRC, taking part in three
        rallies driving a Citroën DS3WRC. He wins the Catalunya Rallye and
        improves his ultimate WRC record with 79 victories. The end of his
        engagement with PSA Group and this last victory give him a taste of come
        back. He then decides to engage with Hyundai for two years on partial
        WRC programmes (6 annual races).

      <h2>2019, a year for new challenges</h2>

      <p>
        After a late decision, Sébastien takes part in the Dakar Rally in
        January 2019, this time not with Peugeot Sport who left the discipline,
        but as a private driver. With his lifelong co-pilot Daniel Elena, he
        achieves one of his best Dakar results with third place on the podium.
        Peugeot Sport’s withdrawal from rallycross world championship leaves
        Sébastien on the sidelines for the 2019 season. On top of this, the
        Citroën Racing team with who he won nine rallycross championships
        decides to hire only two cars for the season. Sébastien is unable to
        achieve as much as during 2018 nor complete his programme. He signs with
        Hyundai Motorsport to drive a WRC for the next two years (2019 and
        2020). He competes in six rallies in 2019 and Dani Sordo takes the reins
        for the next eight rallies. Resourceful, Sébastien has launched this new
        WRC season with a view to the future and the lasting ambition to reach
        the leading position. After twenty years of experience, Sébastien finds
        himself with a new team for the first time. Sébastien appreciates change
        as a new lease of life while keeping his distinctive sense of
        competition.
